	Our Commitment to You
At PLAYMATE, your privacy is a top priority. To ensure that you have complete confidence in the services and products you know and like, and to focus on building meaningful relationships, your privacy is a key foundation in how you design and deploy these products and services.

We appreciate the trust you have shown us by providing information and never take it lightly.

We do not compromise your privacy. Design all products and services with your privacy in mind. We engage experts from various fields, including law, security, engineering, product design, and so on, so that we do not make decisions without considering privacy considerations.

We strive to process your data transparently. We understand that insufficient information and overly complex terms are common problems with the privacy policy, since we use many of the same online services you use. In the opposite approach, we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. You actually want to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!

We are committed to keeping your information safe. We have a team focused on keeping your data safe. We constantly update our security practices and invest in security efforts to enhance information security.


Privacy Policy
Welcome to PLAYMATE's Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read this policy.

We thank you for your information and always try to maintain this trust. These efforts begin by helping you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and your options for information. This policy describes our privacy practices in plain language and uses minimum legal and technical terms.

This Privacy Policy will take effect on 1 March 2020. Previous versions of this Privacy Policy, available herein, will apply only until then.

Effective Date: March 1, 2020

1. Information about our company
The companies responsible for your information ("Data Controllers") are as follows -
PLAYMATE
8-14, Baekjegobun-ro 45-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea

2. Where this Privacy Policy applies
This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by PLAYMATE. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as "services" in this Privacy Policy. To further clarify this, we have added links to this Privacy Policy to all applicable services.

Some services may require their own personal information handling policies. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, the policy, not this Privacy Policy, applies.

3. Information we collect
We cannot help you build a meaningful relationship without some information about you, such as basic profile details and your preferred counterpart type. We also collect information from third parties, such as the information you generate when you use a service (such as a contact record) and access our services through your social media account. If you want more information, we will look at it in more detail at:

The information you provide
You choose to provide some information when using our services. This includes:

When you create an account, you provide at least login credentials and some basic details (such as gender and date of birth) that the service requires to function.
When you create a profile, you can share additional information, including details about your personality, lifestyle, interests, and more, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add some content, such as pictures or videos, you can allow access to your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide (e.g., race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religious beliefs) may be considered "special" or "sensitive" information under certain jurisdictions. By choosing to provide this information, you agree to the processing of this information.
If you subscribe to a paid service or purchase from us directly (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you will provide us or our payment service provider with information such as direct payment or credit card number or other financial information.
If you participate in a survey or focus group, you will provide insight into products and services, answers to questions, and reviews of use.
If you choose to participate in our promotion, event, or contest, we will collect the information you use to register or participate.
If you contact the Customer Service team, we collect the information we provide during the contact. Sometimes we monitor or record this contact for training purposes and also to ensure high quality service delivery.
We collect information about the other individuals you provide to complete this request, if you ask someone else to contact you or to process another person's information (for example, if you ask a friend to email you on your behalf).
We also handle the chat between you and other users and the content you post as part of your service operations.
Information we receive from other individuals
In addition to the information you provide yourself, we receive information about you from other individuals, including:

other users
Other users may provide information about you while using our services. For example, we may collect information about you from other users when they contact you.

Social media
You may use social media login (for example, Facebook login) to create and log in to your PLAYMATE account. This allows you to share some of your social media accounts with us without having to remember another user name and password.

Other Partners
We may receive information about you from the partner, for example, if you post an ad on the partner's website and platform (in this case, the partner will be able to communicate details about the success of the campaign).

Information you collect when you use a service
When you use a service, we collect information about the features you used, how you used it, and the devices you use to access the service. For additional details, refer to:

Usage Information
We collect information about your activities from services such as the date and time you logged in, the features you used, the search, click, the page shown to you, the address of the reference webpage, the number of messages you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect to and interact with, the time and date of exchange, and the number of messages you send and receive).

About Devices
We collect information about devices and devices that we use to access services including:

IP addresses, device IDs and types, device specific/app settings and features, app conflicts, ad IDs (e.g., Google AAID and Apple IDFA - these are random generated numbers that can be reset to device settings), browser types, versions and languages, operating systems, time zones, devices, or identifiers (e.g., IME/UDs) associated with other technologies (e.g., MACIDs).
Information about wireless and mobile network connections, such as service providers and signal strength
Information about device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and compasses.
Other information you agree to
If you allow, we may collect accurate geographical locations (latitude and longitude) through various methods (including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections) depending on the services and devices you are using. You may collect geographical locations in the background, even if you are not using the service, provided that the authorization you provide clearly permits. If you refuse permission to collect geographical locations, you will not collect them.
Similarly, if you agree, you can collect your photos and videos (for example, if you want to publish photos, videos, or streaming to a service).

4. Cookie and other similar data collection techniques
We may use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device, and allow other individuals to use them. More information about why we use it (you authentication, remember preferences and settings, remember site traffic and trends, provide and measure advertising campaigns and effectiveness, allow use of social functions), and how you can better control its use through browser settings and other tools can be viewed in your cookie policy.

Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) have a "Do Not Track," or "DNT" feature that tells the website that you do not want to track your online activities. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block the website from collecting some information about the browser user. All browsers do not provide a DNT option and the DNT signal is not yet uniform. For this reason, many companies, including PLAYMATE, are not currently responding to DNT signals.

5. How We Use Information
The main reason we use your information is to provide and improve our services. We also use your information to help maintain your safety and to provide advertisements that may be of interest to you. Please continue to read the following for a detailed explanation and specific examples of the various reasons why we use the information:

To manage your account and provide services
Create and manage accounts.
Provide customer support and respond to requests.
Complete the transaction.
Communicate with you about services including order management and billing.

Show each other user profile.
To ensure consistent experience on devices
Link the various devices you use to ensure you enjoy a consistent service experience across all devices. To do this, when you log in to your account on other devices, you use partial or full IP addresses, browser versions, or similar data on your devices to help you link your device to your account, or to help identify and link your devices.
To provide you with new PLAYMATE services
Register you and display your profile in the new PLAYMATE features and apps.

To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal foundations:

Service to You: In most cases, the reason we process your information is to fulfill the contract we have. For example, as you use our services to build meaningful relationships, we use your information to maintain your account and profile, disclose it to other users, and recommend other users to you.
Reasons: We can use your information if we have a good reason. For example, we analyze users' behavior regarding services to continuously improve products and services, suggest special events that may be of interest to you, and process information for management, fraud detection, and other legal purposes.
Consent: Sometimes we may request your consent to use your information for some specific reasons. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
6. How We Share Information
Our goal is to help build meaningful relationships, so of course, user information is usually shared with other users. We also share some user information with service providers/partners who support service operations, other match group companies, and in some cases law enforcement authorities. For more information on how to share your information with other individuals, please continue to read:

I'm not going to use it with other users.
You will share information with other users when the service voluntarily discloses information (including public profiles). After you release the information, you and we have no control over what other individuals are doing with it, so make sure that the content you share can be easily disclosed.

If you choose to limit what you want to disclose all or some of your profiles, some content, or information about yourself, it will be released according to your settings.

with our service providers/partners
We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties support a variety of activities, including data hosting and maintenance, analysis, customer service, marketing, advertising, payment processing, and security operations. 

We can also distribute and share information with partners who support service advertising. For example, limited information about you can be shared with advertising partners in a non-readable form by a hashtag.

We follow a rigorous qualification process before hiring any service provider or working with any partner. All service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.

I've been working with other Match Group companies.
PLAYMATE is a member of the Match Group Group group that includes websites and apps such as PLAYMATE as of this Privacy Policy (click here for more information).

We share your information with other Match Group companies to help them process your information on our behalf in accordance with our guidelines. Support provided by other Match Group companies may include data hosting and maintenance, customer services, marketing and target advertising, financial and accounting support, a clearer understanding of how our services are used and how users behave to improve our services, and technical processing such as data and system protection and spam, abuse, fraud, infringement, and other illegal activities.

We can also share information with other Match Group companies for legitimate business purposes, such as corporate audits, analysis, and integrated reporting, and compliance with applicable laws. We may also share user information with other Match Group companies to exclude users who have been reported to violate our service terms and/or commit criminal activities and/or misbehavior. In some cases, we may exclude these users from all platforms.

for business dealings
You may transfer your information in whole or in part if you participate in mergers, sales, acquisitions, withdrawals, restructuring, maintenance, decommissioning, bankruptcy or other changes in ownership or control.

a case required by the law
We may (i) comply with legal processes such as court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements, or (iii) support crime prevention or redaction (in each case in accordance with applicable law), or (iii) disclose your information where reasonably necessary to protect all personal safety.

for the execution of legal rights
We may also share information (i) to (ii) to mitigate our liability in actual or threatened litigation; and (ii) to protect the legal rights of users, business partners or other interested parties; and (iii) to carry out the contract with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or otherwise take action against illegal activities, suspected fraud or other misconduct.

Upon your consent or request
We may request your consent to share information with third parties. In this case, we will clarify why we want to share information.

In all of these situations, we may use and share non-personal information (such as device information in the form of non-identifiable processing, general demographics, general behavioral data, geographical location, etc.) in the form of personal information that is unreadable by a hashish human. We can also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (mainly advertisers) to develop and provide targeted advertising on our services, third-party websites or apps, and to analyze and report the ads you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal or personal information in an unreadable form by a hash collected from other sources. Additional information about our cookies and similar technology usage can be found in the Cookie Policy.
7. Transboundary Data Transmission
Information sharing described in Section 6 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, such as transfers to the United States and other jurisdictions. For example, if a service allows users who are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), their personal information is sent to countries outside of EEA. We use standard contract provisions approved by the European Commission or other appropriate protective measures to permit the transfer of data from the EEA to other countries. A standard contract clause is a commitment between companies that transfer personal data, which imposes a legal obligation to protect the privacy and security of your data.

8. Your rights
We have provided you with the following tools because we want you to control your information: -

Access / Update Tools from Services. These are tools and account settings that help you access, modify, or delete information that you have provided to us and is directly related to your account within the service. If you have any questions about this tool and setup, please contact Customer Service here for assistance.
Device authorization. The mobile platform has a system that allows you to authorize or deny certain types of device data, such as contacts, location services, and push notifications. You may change the settings on the device to agree or disagree with the collection of such information or the display of such notifications. Of course, if you change the settings, some services might lose their full functionality.
Delete. You can delete an account using the feature directly from the service.
We want you to understand your right to privacy. Here are some key things to keep in mind:

Review your information. The Personal Information Protection Act may provide you with the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on your right to care, this may be referred to as the right to access, the right to carry, and other modified terms). You can enter these requests here to request a copy of your personal information.
Update your information. If you feel that the information we keep about you is incorrect, or that we no longer have the right to use it, and would like to request correction and deletion of it, or oppose its handling, please contact us here.
To protect you and protect all users, we may request you to present your ID before we can respond to these requests.

Please note that we may reject the request for certain reasons, including if the request is illegal or may infringe on trade secrets, intellectual property or other users' privacy. If you would like to receive information relating to other users (for example, a copy of any messages you have received from the user through the service), another person will need to contact the person in charge of privacy before releasing the information.

In addition, we may not be able to accept some requests against the processing of personal information, especially if these requests may prevent you from further serving us. For example, we cannot provide services if we do not have your date of birth information.

Remove. You can use the standard uninstall process on your device to remove the app to stop all information from the app. If you remove an app from a mobile device, the unique identifier associated with the device will continue to be kept. If you reinstall the app on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-link this identifier to your previous transaction and activity.
Complaints. In some countries, including the European Union, you have the right to complain to the appropriate data protection authorities if you have concerns about how we handle our personal information. The data protection authorities you may complain about may be primarily those in your residential area, or those in which you work or where we are established.
9. Californians
If you are a Californian, you may request notice to disclose the categories of personal information we shared with third parties for direct marketing of third parties over the previous year. To request this notice, please submit your request here. The reception may take 30 days. In order to protect you and protect all users, we may request you to present your ID before we can respond to these requests.

10. How We Protect Your Information
We are committed to protecting you from unauthorized access, unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. Like all technology companies, we do not promise and should not expect that your personal information will always be secure, even if we take steps to secure your information.

We regularly monitor systems for vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly review information collection, archiving, and processing practices to update physical, technical, and organizational security measures.

If we suspect or detect any security breach, we may terminate your use of all or some of your services without notice. If you believe your account or information is no longer secure, please let us know immediately here.

To protect our system and your information from unauthorized access, theft and loss, we have implemented a bug bounty program. Click here for more information on the bug bounty program.

11. The length of time we keep your information
We keep your personal information as permitted by applicable law only for the period required for legitimate business purposes (as referred to in Section 5). To protect the safety and security of users and services, we have established a safe storage period of three months after the account is deleted. Although the account will no longer be visible in the service during this period, the account information will be kept.

In fact, we delete or anonymize your information after deleting your account (after a safe storage period) or after two years of inactivity, except in the following cases:

If we must keep it in order to comply with the applicable law (for example, some "traffic data" will be kept for one year to comply with legal data storage obligations).
If we are required to keep them in order to demonstrate compliance with the applicable laws (e.g., records of consent to the terms and conditions and privacy policies, and other similar consent records, will be kept for five years).
If there are any outstanding issues, claims or disputes in which we are required to keep relevant information until it is resolved;
Information should be kept for legitimate business interests, such as preventing fraud and enhancing user safety and security. For example, you might need to keep information from users who are prohibited from opening new accounts due to risky behavior or security incidents.
Although our systems are designed to implement the data erasure process in accordance with the above guidelines, keep in mind that technical constraints will not guarantee that all data will be deleted within the specified time frame.

12. Protecting the Personal Information of Children
Our services are limited to users over the age of 18. We do not allow users under the age of 18 on the platform and intentionally do not collect personal information from individuals under the age of 18. If you suspect that a user is under 18, use the reporting mechanism available through the service.

13. Changing the Privacy Policy
We are always looking for new and innovative ways to help build meaningful relationships, so this policy can change over time. We'll let you know in advance that you have time to review any significant changes before they take effect.
