Automatic renewal; automatic card payment

Paid subscription services are automatically renewed until you cancel or cancel paid subscription services. When you purchase a paid subscription service, you will be charged monthly for the first subscription within 24 hours of the date of initial purchase using your payment method. Your card payment information is stored for automatic card payment in accordance with the contract and will be used later.

A receipt will be sent to you via email after each payment is made. If you have any objections to the payment you have already made, you should contact Customer Support or your associated third-party account, such as iTunes, if you have a direct charge from PLAYMATE. In addition, you may contact a bank or payment service provider that can guide you through additional information about your rights and the associated time limit.

You may at any time withdraw your consent for automatic card payment by going to the settings of the PLAYMATE or the relevant third-party account. However, please note that you still have an obligation to pay the unpaid bills.

If you want to change or cancel a paid subscription service, you must log in as a third-party account (or set up a PLAYMATE account) and cancel or cancel the paid subscription service as per the procedure, even if you have deleted your account or deleted the PLAYMATE app from your device.

Additional terms and conditions apply if you use your payment method to pay directly to PLAYMATE. If you pay directly to PLAYMATE, PLAYMATE may correct any claim errors or mistakes made by PLAYMATE, even if the payment has already been requested or received. If you proceed with payment in return or refuse to pay the other way, PLAYMATE may terminate your account immediately at its sole discretion.

You may visit PLAYMATE and go to "My Profile" to modify payment method information. If payment is not successful due to expiration, insufficient funds, or other reasons, or if you do not modify payment method information or cancel or cancel paid subscription services, you will be responsible for the outstanding payment, and the PLAYMATE will grant you the right to continue to claim the payment by payment method when updating payment information. This may change your payment date. You will also authorize PLAYMATE to collect replacement and updated credit or debit card numbers and expiration date information as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. Your payment terms are based on your payment method and may be determined by a contract between you and a financial institution, a credit card issuer or a payment service provider of your choice. If you are living outside of the United States, you agree that your payment will be provided as PLAYMATE through MTCH Technology Services Limited.

Power lights and other virtual items. From time to time, you may purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable, and cancelable license to use "virtual items", including, but not limited to, a power-like (collectively referred to as "virtual items"). The balance of the virtual items in your account is a measure of your license terms and does not reflect any real or stored value. Even if you do not use a virtual item, there is no charge. However, licenses for virtual items granted to you will expire under the terms of this Agreement when PLAYMATE ceases to provide services or your account is closed and revoked. PLAYMATE reserves the right to charge for the right to access or use virtual items at its sole discretion, and can also distribute virtual items for charge or free. PLAYMATE can manage, regulate, control, modify or remove virtual items at any time. In exercising this right, PLAYMATE assumes no liability for you or any third party. Virtual items are only re-sold through the service. All purchases and refunds of virtual items through the service are final and non-refundable. Providing a virtual item for use within the service is a service that starts immediately after you accept the purchase of such virtual items. You acknowledge that PLAYMATE is not obliged to refund any virtual items for any reason, and that when the account closes, it will not receive any monetary or other compensation for virtual items not used by the account, whether voluntary or involuntary.

Refund. Generally, all charges for purchase are not refundable, and there is no refund or credit for the period used in part. Exceptions may be made if a refund is requested within 14 days of the transaction date or if the applicable law in your jurisdiction stipulates a refund.

Subscribers living in the European Union or the European Economic Area are entitled to a full refund for 14 days after the subscription is initiated without specifying the reason. Please note that this 14-day period starts when a paid subscription service is launched.

Purchase of virtual item is final and non-refundable.
To request a refund:
If you subscribe using an Apple ID, the refund will be processed by Apple, not by PLAYMATE. To request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID, select "Purchase History," locate the transaction, and click "Report Problem." You can also submit a request at https://getsupport.apple.com.

If you have used your Google Play store account or applied for a paid subscription service directly via PLAYMATE: Please contact Customer Support with your Google Play store or PLAYMATE order number. You can find the Google Play store order number by logging into your order confirmation email or Google Wallet. The PLAYMATE order number is provided in the order confirmation email. You may also mail or forward a notice, signed and dated, containing you as Buyer of cancellation of this Agreement or similar effect. Please include the email address or phone number associated with your account along with your order number. Please send the notice to: PLAYMATE
8-14, Baekjegobun-ro 45-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea

Alternatively, you can use the standard cancellation form (Appendix 1) but is not required.

Exception of the Cancellation: In the event that you exercise your right to cancel (except if purchased through Apple's authorized Apple ID), we do not delay any payment received from you unfairly, and will refund or request a refund from Google within 14 days from the date we are notified of your decision to cancel your contract. We proceed with such a refund using the same payment method you used in your initial transaction. Under no circumstances will you be charged a refund fee.

Cancellation Result: Orders for the provision of digital content not delivered by physical means cannot be cancelled if the processing of the order has been initiated as you expressly agree and acknowledge that you will lose the right to cancel. For example, purchasing a virtual item is the case. This means that these purchases are final and non-refundable.

Excluded are users who reside in the European Union or the European Economic Zone and other areas prohibited by applicable law:

The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising from or in connection with this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or any service is binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with consumer arbitration rules. One exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to make personal claims to the Company to a small court of jurisdiction. However, no matter whether you choose to arbitrate or choose a small tribunal, you may not, under any circumstances, initiate or maintain a class action, group arbitration, or any other representative litigation or proceedings against the Company.
By using the service in any way, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, you waive your right to go to court to affirm or defend any claim between you and the Company (except for matters that may be brought up by the Small Tribunal). You also waive your right to participate in class action or other class action proceedings. Your rights are determined by a neutral arbitrator, not by a judge or jury, who determines all matters concerning the possibility of arbitration in a dispute. You have the opportunity to appeal before an arbitrator. The arbitrator may grant court relief, but you should know that the arbitration procedure is usually simpler and simpler than the trial and other judicial proceedings. The decision by the arbitrator is enforceable by the court and can only be reversed for very limited reasons. Refer to our arbitration procedures for details of the arbitration procedure.
Any proceedings to enforce this arbitration agreement, including proceedings to confirm, amend or invalidate arbitration decisions, may begin in all courts of your jurisdiction. If this arbitration agreement is found to be non-executive for any reason, all proceedings against the Company (except for minor court cases) may only begin in federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby consent to the terms and conditions of irrevocability of such jurisdiction for such purposes.
This Agreement and any dispute between you and the Company shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to the principles of out-of-court. However, this arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
The European Commission's online dispute settlement platform is available at http://ec.europa.eu/odr. PLAYMATE does not participate in dispute resolution procedures in front of the European Union or consumer arbitration body for users living in the European Economic Area.

17. The place.
Except for users residing in the European Union or the European Economic Area who may make claims in their country of residence in accordance with the Act, and any claims arising from or relating to this Agreement or Services, except for claims that may be suitably filed by the Tribal State or Dallas County, Texas, under any circumstances, will be brought to the U.S. District Court of State for exclusive arbitration. You and PLAYMATE agree to the Texas State Court¡¯s exercise of human jurisdiction and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient jurisdiction.

18.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and protect against all complaints, claims, damages, losses, costs, responsibilities and expenses, including the costs of lawyers arising from or relating to PLAYMATE, our Affiliates, and their respective directors, directors, agents and employees, access or use of services, your content, or in any violation of this Agreement.

19. Full contract, etc.
This Agreement, together with all terms and conditions disclosed and agreed to by you when you purchase the Privacy Policy, Safety Tips, and any additional features, products or services offered by us in the Services, includes a complete agreement between You and PLAYMATE regarding the use of the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is found invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue to be in full force. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your PLAYMATE account is non-transferable and that all your rights to your account and its contents will terminate upon your death. As a result of this Agreement, there will be no representation, partnership, joint venture, new relationship, or employment of any other party, and in any way you may represent or constrain PLAYMATE on behalf of PLAYMATE.
